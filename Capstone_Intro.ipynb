    "\n",
    "In past decade, some of Indian cities have seen drastic change in term of the living condition, population, infrastructure, cost of living and facilities. National capital region (NCR) of the country has seen many changes in last 3 decades. \n",
    "\n",
    "Getting new metro cities like Gurgaon and Noida, hosting many industries, getting new problems (high pollution and high population) are some of the changes the NCR has experienced over the period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from having its own problems, still this region of the country provides many opportunity to the people of the nearest state to join fastly growing automobile, textile and IT industries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Millions of people join the NCR region every year. Providing affordable accommodation with basic facilities to all the existing and ever-growing population of this region have been a great challenge for the local bodies and government.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will try to find the affordable accommodation options and facilities which are available around these areas and will try to find the factors which have impact on the pricing of the flat or house.\n"
